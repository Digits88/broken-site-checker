Checks all sites on a multisite and archives any that are inaccessable.

## Description ##

Large networks can get a bit unweidly. On occasion there are mapped domains that won't load and this breaks the network upgrade process. This loops through all "active" sites in a multisite network and archives any sites that can't be reached.

## Installation ##

1. Network Activate plugin and visit Network Admin > Sites > Broken Link Checker
